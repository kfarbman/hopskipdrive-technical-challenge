Other data I would want:
-How long the ride will be
-How far away it is
-What day of the week
-What time of day
-Seasonality (weather conditions, traffic, back-to-school, etc)
-Are drivers choosing between multiple rides at the same time
-How long before the ride was it requested
-Data on why drivers are waiting - is it just to get more money or is it for other reasons (they didn't see the ride, any of the other points from above, etc)
-Time since boost

Questions:
-Is driver supply at the time of the request or number of drivers that will be driving when the ride takes place?
-If it is drivers at the time of rquest, how do we know how many people are planning on driving when the ride happens?
-Why would base_plus_boost matter?
-Is time between boosts always 5 minutes, or does that change in the real data? I'd be curious to look at time between boosts or since last boost

Complications with synthetic data:
-Average boosts is around 5 for all metro areas, and it's pretty uniformly distributed - is that typical?
-Day and time of the ride and the request time are all just increasing by an hour, so it's not something to consider here
-A BIG challenge with this data is not being able to use performance as a tool for improvement - if a model isn't performing well, I can't say if it's a bad approach or if it's just the synthetic data

Ideas:
-Maybe start off with a higher price and decrease as it goes on so drivers will pick it up sooner
-Maybe have the first boost be a large one and then decrease the boost amount as it goes on
-Maybe offer a bonus (or some other incentive) to drivers who pick rides up within a certain number of boosts (less than 5) that is slightly less than the price increase would be with 5 boosts
-Try A/B testing some of these methods
-Cluster rides to group similar rides - similar boosting patterns may appear
-Try having a baseline model with no boost information, getting a probability of a ride being picked up within a certain amount of time, and then adding a boost model to see what the impact of different boosting strategies is on the likelihood of pickup within a certain amount of time

Thoughts:
-There are not really enough features from prior to boosting to predict how much the price will increase or how many boosts will be needed
-Picking up rides sooner can save the company money by saving other teams from working on getting a driver and having happier returning customers - how much more can we pay up front to drivers to make that even out?
-I like to try different approaches and compare the insights from the approaches to figure out which is more useful

Observations:
-The average total price is about $5 higher for claimed rides than when they are not claimed
-The average total boost amount when claimed is about $10 over the base price
-The total price tends to be higher when there are fewer available drivers
